              high interindividual variation. We describe a dimensionality
              reduction tool, compositional tensor factorization (CTF), that
              incorporates information from the same host across multiple
              samples to reveal patterns driving differences in microbial
              composition across phenotypes. CTF identifies robust patterns in
              sparse compositional datasets, allowing for the detection of
              microbial changes associated with specific phenotypes that are
              reproducible across datasets.",
